10 (will look bad if it is anything else (sharpness of the edges)), Strength of Shockwave (Maybe dissipation), Overall Size

CurrentTime = larger # means greater radius
powDiff = 0.0 ; If it is not, it will grab pixels that are not in the center
diff = dissipation
diffUV = what dirrection the shift is in (i.e. diagonally)
