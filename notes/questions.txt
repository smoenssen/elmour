Is inventory list for whole party or per character?

Is weapon list for whole party or per character?

How do you select a weapon?

If you have a weapon in inventory, can it only be assigned to one character? 
i.e., Do you have to have 5 swords in order to for every character to have a sword in a battle?

Where are initial stats for weapons going to be stored?
i.e., Are weapons going to be defined in Inventory.json? (InventoryCategory has a Weapon cateogory)?

How are weapons obtained? Same as inventory items?
