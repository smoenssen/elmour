Walking up to NPC and interacting can:
- do simple conversation
- kick off a chapter cutscene
- kick off a quest cutscene

the last 2 will require a fade out and fade in

cutscenes can also be kicked-off by just walking into a map area

need to add support for dependencies for making quests available

The following will fade characters in if put in the screen's show function
_stage.getRoot().getColor().a = 0;
_stage.getRoot().addAction(Actions.fadeIn(2.0f));
