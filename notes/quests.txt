Map
QUEST_DISCOVER_LAYER
QUEST_ITEM_SPAWN_LAYER

Quest map object:
questID is the object name on the map - all objects of the same quest will have the same questID
taskID is a custom property that matches id of task in .json file

taskProperties:
TARGET_TYPE is path to .json config file (for RETURN quests or FETCH type quests on QUEST_ITEM_SPAWN_LAYER)
TARGET_LOCATION is name of map

Questions:
Should we have a split window for Quest and associated quest tasks to show what has been done and what still needs to be done?
