Map
QUEST_DISCOVER_LAYER
QUEST_ITEM_SPAWN_LAYER

Quest map object:
questID is the object name on the map - all objects of the same quest will have the same questID
taskID is a custom property that matches id of task in .json file

taskProperties:
TARGET_TYPE is path to .json config file (for RETURN quests or FETCH type quests on QUEST_ITEM_SPAWN_LAYER)
TARGET_LOCATION is name of map

Notes:
Remove targetLocation from QuestTask?
Usage of targetEntity:
	search for getTargetEntity
	used for KeyItem.ID for FETCH tasks
	used for Entity ID in QuestGraph::setQuestComplete and PlayerHUD::OnNotify::TASK_COMPLETE for saveLatestEntityConversationConfig
	Is it correct to set all conversation configs to POST_QUEST_DIALOG in setQuestComplete?
	In PlayerHUD::OnNotify::TASK_COMPLETE shouldn't call saveLatestEntityConversationConfig for FETCH tasks (and maybe others?)
Post task conversation type:
	When task is complete, and if there is a post task dialog, save post task dialog to profile for the NPC

Issues
------
None

Todo:
-----
Add chapter range to NORMAL_DIALOG
Can RETURN_QUEST be removed?
EXIT_CUTSCENE for quests?
Need to figure out FETCH task - see GetMaterials2 trying to get tools, talk to Justin
Add sequence number to task - Data description maybe? Super tasks also have an order.
Add function that cut scene can call to remove key item from inventory
Adjust quests: setting task to complete should cascade down and set all tasks complete in that path. Also allow setting quest complete (same thing with cascading downstream quests).

Map
---
	- For quests launched by interacting with NPC
		Add character spawn object on SPAWNS_LAYER
		Add "chapters" under Custom Properties - this is the chapter range for quest, e.g., 1-5
		Add "taskIDs" under Custom Properties - this is the list of quest tasks in the form <Quest ID>::<Task ID list separated by commas>
			The QuestID::TaskID lists are separated by semi-colons
			e.g., TeddyBear::FindTeddyBear,AnotherTeddyBearTask;AnotherQuestID::YetAnotherTask
	- For quests launched by discovering a map area
		Add object to MAP_QUEST_DISCOVER_LAYER
		Add "chapters" and "taskIDs" under Custom Properties (see above)
	- For HIDDEN_ITEM on HIDDEN_ITEMS_LAYER
		Add custom properties:
			id = KeyItem id
			text = text to display when item is found
			layer = name of layer to render hidden item
			- if quest type:
				taskID = quest ID::task ID
			Note: need to reload hidden items each time map is loaded
			 		- whenever quest is started or progresses
					- whenever hidden item is found (send message to maps?)

yEd for quest conversations
---------------------------
  Use EXIT_CONVERSATION in cut scenes
  Use EXIT_CHAT in normal dialog
  Use TASK_COMPLETE in task dialog, which includes data <questID::taskID>
	Use TASK_COMPLETE_CUTSCENE in task dialog, which includes data <questID::taskID>;<map spawn location>;<map>

yEd for quest graphs
--------------------
Color = task types
	FETCH			= cc99ff	(purple)
	KILL			= ff0000	(red)
	DELIVERY	= c0c0c0	(gray)
	GUARD			= 3366ff	(blue)
	ESCORT		= 33cccc	(turquoise)
	RETURN		= ffcc00	(gold)
	DISCOVER	= 00ff00	(green)
Text = task ID
URL = Phrase with an optional Hint using # as a delimiter (e.g., "Get CDs#hint for getting CDs")
Description will be <Target Entity>;<ConversationType>;<Post Task ConversationType>;<Target Number>
	For FETCH "Target Entity" is the KeyItem ID
	The last two are optional, but if you want a Target Number but not Post Task ConversationType, then you still need the extra semi-colon:
		e.g., OPHION;ACTIVE_QUEST_DIALOG1;;5
Note: Description is not needed for  (this is set in the map custom property)

Quests will be Groups
URL = Quest Title
Text = Quest ID
Description = <Minimum chapter>;<Quest giver>;<Gold>;<XP>
