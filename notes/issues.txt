BLOCK_RIGHT in hit.json crashes

Can't block daggers or punching

when exiting battle and re-entering immediately, character locations are messed up

inventory.json and equipment.json
EVO->AVO


make sure number of turns executed is correct

Re-entering battle too fast results in extra characters being displayed (but not in left hand HUD list)
If used 2 potions of strength, crashes when attacking.
