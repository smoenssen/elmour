turnEffectList is per character

When Inventory or Spell/Power is applied, add effectItems to turnEffectList
Set the turns to the item's turns value, and if there is none use the InventoryElement turns value

Special cases:
HP and MP should either use the item's turns value, and if there is none just use the effect once

whenever a value is retrieved from statusUI, loop through the turnEffectList and apply UP/DOWN calculation on base stat

HP and MP are the actual values
All other values are a percentage (round up)

When turn is done, loop through turnEffectList and decrement turns for each EffectItem
If turns == 0, then remove EffectItem from turnEffectList
